# RAG_Demo
This repository allows you to start up a local hosted instance of Mixstral 7x8B for the purpose of RAG.
Documents are indexed through Qdrant, allowing for fast retrieval.
Additionally you are able to chat with this RAG agent through the terminal.

Because this is based off of pdf documents, OCR is used for text and figure extraction.

### TODO:
- Implement OCR
- Implement parsing of PDFs
- test?
